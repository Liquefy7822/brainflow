# BrainFlow 🧠

A session-based, brain-inspired note app for visual thinking.

BrainFlow is an experimental web app designed around how people actually think — in messy, time-based, interconnected ideas rather than rigid folders and documents.

Every time you open the app, a new thinking session begins.  
Sessions can be linked visually like a mind map to reflect how thoughts naturally connect.

## ✨ Core Idea

Most note apps focus on organization first.  
BrainFlow focuses on **thinking first**.

- Thoughts are messy  
- Ideas evolve over time  
- Context matters  
- Associations > categories  

BrainFlow lets structure **emerge naturally** instead of forcing it.

This is not a productivity app.  
This is a **thinking space**.

Messy first.  
Structure later.
